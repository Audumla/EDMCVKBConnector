## v0.9.0 — 2026-02-22

This release focuses on a clearer, more consistent Settings experience and a built‑in updater for the EDMC plugin. It also polishes VKB‑Link update feedback and tidies the release process.

### New Features
- Added a built‑in EDMC plugin updater that downloads and installs the latest release from GitHub via the new Update EDMC Plugin button.

### Improvements
- Reorganized the Settings tab: VKB Connector and Static Shift share the top row; VKB‑Link now spans the full width below.
- Streamlined VKB‑Link controls into a single line and moved its status and update action to the right of Auto‑manage; kept Locate inline.
- Clarified labels: the Plugin frame is now VKB Connector and the version label reads Current Version.
- Right‑aligned the Update EDMC Plugin button while keeping version text on the left; the button label stays consistent after checks.
- VKB‑Link updates now use button text feedback (e.g., Checking… → Update VKB‑Link) and show success/error popups; connection/app status refreshes after completion.
- Fixed widths for both update buttons so temporary label changes (like Checking…) don’t resize the layout.
- Removed the “Rule saved successfully” popup after editing a rule; saving still persists changes and closes the editor.

### Build / Packaging
- Cleaned up the changelog to remove duplicates, ensuring release notes generate reliably.
