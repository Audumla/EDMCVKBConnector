  "unreleased:8f202e03f180": "The Bash shell doesn't appear to be functional in the current environment. I'll summarize directly from the CHANGELOG.json I've already read.\n\n---\n\n## Unreleased Changelog Summary\n\nAll 14 entries are `unreleased` across three themes:\n\n### VKB-Link Process Management (`vkb-link-recovery`, `vkb-link-separation`)\n- **CHG-55c6ba67-1** â€” Enforced restart-after-confirmed-stop; removed obsolete socket retry/cooldown timer config\n- **CHG-55c6ba67-3** â€” Made process monitor interval configurable; unified timer keys to seconds, reduced UI timer knobs\n- **CHG-fc428a14** â€” Centralized VKB-Link process monitoring and listener-probe logic in `VKBLinkManager`; `EventHandler` now delegates connect/recovery flows to the manager\n- **CHG-fc428a14-1** â€” Moved INI endpoint parsing into `VKBLinkManager`; updated integration tests for manager-backed behavior\n\n### Release Workflow & Build (`release-workflow-configurable-backends`, `changelogsummarization`)\n- **CHG-1f5c0aba** â€” Added `claude-cli` summarization backend so release prep works via VS Code Claude extension without an API key\n- **CHG-1f5c0aba-1** â€” Release script now aborts on summarization failure instead of silently falling back\n- **CHG-1f5c0aba-2** â€” Added `scripts/release_workflow.py` with selectable summarizer backend and bump strategy (`auto|patch|minor|major`); wired VS Code tasks and release-please workflow inputs\n- **CHG-1f5c0aba-3** â€” `release_workflow.py` now reads current version from `.release-please-manifest.json` to keep `--bump` aligned with release-please state\n\n### Changelog / Tooling Infrastructure\n- **CHG-55c6ba67** â€” Migrated all changelog IDs from timestamp-based to `CHG-<commit-hash>` format\n- **CHG-55c6ba67-2** â€” Renamed `config_defaults.json` â†’ `changelog-config.json`; clarified config section names; added `_comment` fields\n- **CHG-55c6ba67-4** â€” Moved changelog files into `docs/changelog/` subdirectory\n- **CHG-0c018dfd** â€” Removed verbose meta-commentary from release notes formatting\n- **CHG-3dbb20de** â€” Increased group ID length limits (48â†’70 / 64â†’75 chars) to preserve meaningful names\n- **CHG-c71b0c59** â€” Refactored group naming to extract short 2-4 word topic names; group names now 20-38 chars\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The `changelog_activity.py --strict` script failed to execute (shell appears non-functional in this session). The summary above is drawn directly from `docs/changelog/CHANGELOG.json`. To generate the formal `dist/RELEASE_NOTES.preview.md`, run the script manually in a terminal:\n\n```bash\npython scripts/changelog_activity.py --strict\n```",
  "unreleased:d50cd218604c": "## Unreleased\nThis release focuses on making releases and changelog generation more reliable, while simplifying VKB-Link behavior and configuration. It also improves readability of project changelogs and adds more flexible tooling for release workflows.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Fixed VKB-Link restart handling so the app confirms the old process has fully stopped before starting a new one, reducing restart race conditions.\n- Removed silent fallback behavior during release-note summarization; release prep now fails clearly when summarization fails.\n- Fixed version bump calculations to use the release manifest as the source of truth, preventing mismatched forced bump versions.\n- Fixed Codex-based summarization in VS Code by improving CLI detection and using the current execution interface.\n\n### New Features\n- Added a `claude-cli` summarization backend so changelog summaries can run from the VS Code Claude extension without requiring an API key.\n- Added a configurable release workflow script with selectable summarization backend and bump strategy (`auto`, `patch`, `minor`, `major`).\n\n### Improvements\n- Simplified and standardized changelog IDs to shorter, clearer formats while keeping them unique and merge-safe.\n- Reorganized changelog files into `docs/changelog/` for better structure and discoverability.\n- Improved release-note formatting to remove metadata noise and make grouped changes easier to scan.\n- Refined change-group naming so group titles are shorter, clearer, and more meaningful.\n- Clarified and cleaned up changelog configuration names and defaults for better self-documentation.\n- Simplified VKB-Link configuration by removing obsolete retry/cooldown settings and consolidating timer options around seconds-based keys.\n- Made process monitoring intervals configurable and reduced UI timer knobs by deriving feedback timing from existing poll settings.\n- Centralized VKB-Link monitoring, listener probing, and endpoint handling in the manager layer, and updated callers/tests to use the unified APIs."
