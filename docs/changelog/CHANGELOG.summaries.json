  "0.9.0:4e1b4c88326e": "This release focuses on a clearer, more consistent Settings experience and a built‑in updater for the EDMC plugin. It also polishes VKB‑Link update feedback and tidies the release process.\n\n### New Features\n- Added a built‑in EDMC plugin updater that downloads and installs the latest release from GitHub via the new Update EDMC Plugin button.\n\n### Improvements\n- Reorganized the Settings tab: VKB Connector and Static Shift share the top row; VKB‑Link now spans the full width below.\n- Streamlined VKB‑Link controls into a single line and moved its status and update action to the right of Auto‑manage; kept Locate inline.\n- Clarified labels: the Plugin frame is now VKB Connector and the version label reads Current Version.\n- Right‑aligned the Update EDMC Plugin button while keeping version text on the left; the button label stays consistent after checks.\n- VKB‑Link updates now use button text feedback (e.g., Checking… → Update VKB‑Link) and show success/error popups; connection/app status refreshes after completion.\n- Fixed widths for both update buttons so temporary label changes (like Checking…) don’t resize the layout.\n- Removed the “Rule saved successfully” popup after editing a rule; saving still persists changes and closes the editor.\n\n### Build / Packaging\n- Cleaned up the changelog to remove duplicates, ensuring release notes generate reliably."
